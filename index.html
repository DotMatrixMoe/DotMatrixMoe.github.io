				<h3 style="font-family: road-rage; font-size: 35px; color: white; padding: 20 0 5 40;">So, What's the Big Deal?</h3>
				<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45"> Volcanoes are typically known for its disastrous effects on the land surrounding it. In many movies, houses are engulfed in its lava, and hundreds of people are killed! Though it may seem simple from the outside, these beasts do much more than meets the eye.  
		Join me, and we'll explore the volcanoes' nature and how they <strong>really</strong> work!</p>

			<h3 style="font-family: road-rage; font-size: 35px; color: white; padding: 20 0 5 40;">What Are They Exactly?</h3>
			<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45;">Volcanoes are gaps between two tectonic plates. Inside those gaps, there are tons of molten rocks known as <strong>magma</strong>. It's a result of a divergent boundary making a big enough opening for magma to come out of. They can be the tallest mountain, or the smallest hill. Heck, they can even be underwater!

			<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45">No matter the size or place, they can be extremely dangerous! And they're definitely something you shouldn't touch. Lava can get as hot as 1,000 degrees Celsius, you know!</p>

			<h3 style="font-family: road-rage; font-size: 35px; color: white; padding: 20 0 5 40;">Alright, Then. How do they Work?</h3>
			<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45">The burning of the rocks creates excess gasses such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen halides. They build up between the rocks, putting more and more pressure in the volcano. Once it reaches its peak, the magma comes splurging out, and sometimes... <strong>EXPLODE!</strong> See this video of a volcanic eruption!</p>

			<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45">If you were able to see the video, you saw the gasses quickly emerged from out the volcano, and released lots of pressure. (That loud sound was the pressure. Crazy, right?)

			<h3 style="font-family: road-rage; font-size: 35px; color: white; padding: 20 0 5 40;">Tell us more!</h3>
			<p style="font-family: roboto-mono; color: white; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 45 0 45">A famous eruption in the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, occurred in 79 AD. It was huge, and killed hundreds of people! Pompeii and Herculeaneum were not safe, as they were almost or completely engulfed by the lava! Fossils of Pompeii's residents are still safe beneath our ground. Did you also know that most of Earth was once a volcano? Because of its many eruptions, it eventually created the seafloor we are familiar with. Bet you didn't expect that, huh.
